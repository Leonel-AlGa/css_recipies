            <h1 class="Encima">Apple Pie</h1>
                <p>This was Juan Carlos apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>
                  quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place<br>
                  prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

      <h2>Directions </h2>
          <ul>
              <ol>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br>
                flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
                temperature and let simmer.</ol>
              <ol>2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
                lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
                  that it does not run off. </ol>
              <ol>3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                   degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</ol>
